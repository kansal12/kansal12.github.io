At Platy Studio, we combine our passion for high-quality cinema with cutting-edge AI technology to redefine video production. Inspired by the immense potential of great entertainment to uplift society and driven by our excitement about advancements in large language models, we are addressing challenges that resonate deeply with us consumers of entertainment content. 

Our initial focus is on revolutionizing dubbing and karaoke generationâ€”empowering our customers- multimedia production studios and OTT platforms, to deliver exceptional content. We are developing a robust software solution to streamline the workflow for these use cases. Our software product seamlessly integrates with our portfolio of proprietary AI models, open-source models, their fine-tuned variants, model ensembles and 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation' (RAG) models. We believe our customers need an end to end solution that stiches all the AI/tech capabilities, manages the unreliability typically seen in the outputs of generative AI models, provide them a way to supervise the internal workings and offer them a solution to further improve the quality in case they are not satified with certain sections. Our key differentiator throughout our offerings is 'box-office' quality output. For that reason and given the current technological evolution, we only work on non-live content.
